# Lab 0: Validate lab environment

### Estimated Duration: 15 minutes

## Overview

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visitors are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus.

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus.

In this Module-lab 0, you will acquire a Power Platform trial and access the Power Platform admin center. In the admin center, you will then create a **Practice** environment that will be used for majority of the lab executions.
